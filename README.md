## Task3

---
Create the method writeFile(String filename, String text) 
that write the text to file as sequence of bytes in binary format.

---
For example, the text fragment


>        Hello!
should be represented in the file as a sequence of 7-bit bytes 
without spaces between them:


>        100100011001011101100110110011011110100001

---
If less than 7 bits are required to represent the character 
then add to binary sequence leading zeros '0'.

---
* For correct passing of all tests don't use print and println methods in your code.

### When you will paste code to Moodle, paste only method
